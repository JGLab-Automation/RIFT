2  module rw-feature

2.1  rw-feature data
  Description
    This module defines the platform-global features enabled in a
    RIFT.ware installation.  This module covers the base platform only.
    Specific applications and products may define additional features
    and the configuration required to enable the features.

    Features, as used in this context, are not related to the yang
    'feature' statements, although there may be some conceptual
    overlap.  RIFT.ware features may some day include yang model
    changes under the yang feature syntax.  RIFT.ware features, in this
    context, do not affect the configuration or state presented by the
    system.  Rather, they affect the way the system should be presented
    to the user in the UI or the way the system functions.

2.1.1  container rw-feature:rw-feature-state
  Description
    Operational state for RIFT.ware platform-global features.

2.1.1.1  list rw-feature:feature
  Description
    List of features available in the RIFT.ware instance.
  Leaves
    name: feature-name, type: STRING, description: The name of the feature.

    Feature names of the form PREFIX:NAME are reserved for
    integration with the yang 'feature' statement.  Values that
    contain exactly one colon should be yang features, with the
    associated NETCONF requirements.  All other values are
    arbitrarily defined by the RIFT.ware platform or application,
    and do not have yang 'feature' semantics.
    name: value, type: STRING, description: The value of the feature.  Possibly qualifies the status of
    the feature, as per the description.
    name: description, type: STRING, description: Description of the feature.  Defines the possibled values.
