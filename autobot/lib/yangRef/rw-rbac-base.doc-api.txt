2  module rw-rbac-base

2.1  rw-rbac-base notification
  Description
    This module defines the basic constructs for Role-Based Access
    Control (RBAC), as implemented by RIFT.ware.  This module is
    intended to be imported by other modules in order to obtain
    identity, grouping, and extension definitions.  This module does
    not contain data, or RPCs.

2.1.1  notification rw-rbac-base:user-created
  Description
    User is created
  Leaves
    name: user-domain, type: LEAFREF, description: The user domain.  This is the source of the user identity.
    Different domains may duplicate a user-name, but such users
    would be considered distinct by RIFT.ware.
    name: user-name, type: STRING, description: The user name.  The syntax of this name depends on the domain.
    For example, if the domain is a login name, it might be limited
    to alphanumeric characters.  However, if the domain is some
    kind of email address, the syntax could include assitional
    characters, such as the at sign.
